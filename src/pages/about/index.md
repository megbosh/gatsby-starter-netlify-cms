title: About Megan
---
Megan is a passionate email designer and developer who believes her work can be used to make a positive impact in a world that seems increasingly divided. This core belief led her to the Harold Grinspoon Foundation in 2017, where she works as the Email Marketing Specialist, creating responsive and engaging emails for the Foundation’s PJ Library program.\
\
In 2014, she co-founded Mango & Marigold Press (formerly Bharat Babies), an award-winning independent publishing house that shares the sweet and savory experiences of the South Asian experience. Because of this work, Megan has been featured in Mailchimp’s “What’s in Store” newsletter. Additionally, Megan created the brand identity for HikeMF, which has raised over $180,000 for MPN cancer research.\
\
Megan is able to create emails from design through development, QA, and deployment. She is most proficient with Mailchimp and has familiarity with additional email service providers. She is always eager to acquire new skills and can learn established processes or develop new ones as needed.\

In her spare time, Megan likes to spend time practicing Crossfit and taking photos of her two dogs, Orly and Momo.
